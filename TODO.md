Cross-cutting personal action items that don't fit existing docs. Operational

## Engine structural redesign (post-2026-05-15 sweep)

The 2026-05-15 parameter sweeps validated the targeted fixes (Sigma SPY-
regime filter, Reversion Z-relaxation + T3 expansion) at the metric level
but DSR/credibility gates remain structurally blocked.

- **Sigma structural redesign.** 2026-05-15 sweep with regime filter
  applied: 80% of walk-forward Sharpe rows are negative (-3.265 to
  +1.454, median -0.666). The regime filter eliminated the −0.84
  parameter-stability swing — that win is real — but the underlying
  range-scalping signal is fragile across most market windows. Held-back
  +0.839 Sharpe / 86 trades / credibility 50 / DSR 0.0000. The next
  experiment is NOT more parameter sweeps. Candidate redesigns: (a) shift
  from band-touch entries to band-mean-reversion confirmations (require
  close back inside band before entry); (b) require explicit volatility-
  contraction prerequisite (BB-width percentile rank < N before entry);
  (c) abandon range-scalping for trend-pullback if the market structure
  is fundamentally different from the 2018-2023 calibration window.
  Decision deferred until operator picks a redesign path.
  **OU mean-reversion gate spike — rejected 2026-05-15.** Tested as one
  candidate redesign path; 50-trial walk-forward sweep showed the gate
  cut more trades in stable windows than fragile ones, regressing held-
  back Sharpe +0.839 → +0.366. Code archived in
  `tpcore/backtest/spread_estimator_archive.py`.

- **Reversion — reclassified as satellite 2026-05-15 (closed).** The
  signal-class-redesign decision was resolved by reclassifying Reversion
  as a satellite engine alongside S2: permanent 5–10% capital cap,
  per-trade graduation criteria, DSR gate retired. The combined filter
  (Z ≥ 3.0 + HIGH earnings quality) produces 19 trades / Sharpe +0.312
  / PF 1.755 / max DD −11.5% on 2018-2025 — strong per-trade metrics at
  a structurally bounded firing rate. See `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` §4.2 and
  `backtests/reversion_satellite_backtest.json`.

## Publishing

- **Publish a GitHub gist of the entire project.** Scope: everything —
  architecture (`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`), database + dataflow
  (`docs/DATABASE_AND_DATAFLOW.md`), operations (`docs/OPERATIONS.md`),
  style guide, engine specs (Sigma, Reversion, Vector, Momentum) with
  credibility scorecards, parameter-search methodology + walk-forward +
  held-back DSR, 5-plug architecture, FilterDiagnostics + baseline-
  equivalence framework, dashboard, the Railway/Supabase ops story.
  Public-facing — review for any embedded keys, paths, or PII before
  publishing.
- **Publish to PyPI.** Open scope — decide what gets packaged. Most likely
  candidate: `tpcore/` as a standalone library (RiskGovernor, AAR,
  parity, backtest harness, filter diagnostics, baseline-equivalence) —
  the parts that are genuinely reusable outside this repo. Engines
  (`sigma/`, `reversion/`, `vector/`, `momentum/`) and `platform/`
  schema stay private. Prereqs: pick a name (likely not `tpcore` —
  reserved/generic), pin a license, add `pyproject.toml` package
  metadata, set up `python -m build` + `twine upload`, decide on
  versioning scheme. Same key/PII review as the gist.
